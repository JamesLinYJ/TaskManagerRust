[![CI](https://github.com/JamesLinYJ/taskmgr-rs/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JamesLinYJ/taskmgr-rs/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A Windows task manager written in Rust with native Win32 APIs. The UI follows the older Task Manager layout, while sampling and background refresh use current Windows interfaces.

This is not a copy of the modern Task Manager. CPU and GPU details come from system APIs rather than model lookup tables. If Windows does not return a value, the UI says it is unavailable. A failed refresh also leaves the last valid result on screen instead of replacing it with zeros.

## Pages

- **Applications** lists top-level windows and can switch to, minimize, maximize, or end a task.
- **Processes** uses a virtual list with sortable and movable columns. Process actions verify both the PID and creation time before they run.
- **Performance** shows CPU, per-logical-processor, and memory history. CPU labels can include processor groups, efficiency classes, and SMT thread numbers.
- **CPU** shows the processor name, effective frequency, topology, caches, virtualization, ISA features, system rates, and a 60-second utilization graph.
- **GPU** handles multiple adapters and engines, dedicated and shared memory, temperature, driver details, and DirectX information.
- **Networking and Users** show adapter throughput history and Windows session state.

## Download

The current build is on the [Releases page](https://github.com/JamesLinYJ/taskmgr-rs/releases/latest):

- [Windows x86_64](https://github.com/JamesLinYJ/taskmgr-rs/releases/latest/download/taskmgr-windows-x86_64.exe) for most Intel and AMD Windows PCs.
- [Windows x86](https://github.com/JamesLinYJ/taskmgr-rs/releases/latest/download/taskmgr-windows-x86.exe) for 32-bit Windows.
- [Windows ARM64](https://github.com/JamesLinYJ/taskmgr-rs/releases/latest/download/taskmgr-windows-arm64.exe) for Windows on Arm devices.

All three downloads are single EXE files. The program asks for administrator access because some process and session actions require it.

The release files are not code-signed at the moment, so Windows may show a SmartScreen warning. Each release includes SHA-256 hashes for manual verification.

## Windows support

Most development and hands-on testing currently happens on Windows 11 x86_64. The
[compatibility matrix](docs/compatibility-matrix.md) records Windows/architecture and GPU evidence
without treating a cross-build or an unrecorded development machine as hardware verification.

The GPU page needs the `GPU Engine` and `GPU Adapter Memory` performance counters exposed by Windows and the display driver. When those counters are missing, the page reports that state instead of drawing a flat 0% graph.

ARM64, x86-64 and x86 release builds were compiled and exercised on a Windows ARM64 virtual
machine (Insider build 29671.1000) on 2026-09-21. See the [compatibility matrix](docs/compatibility-matrix.md)
for the exact test scope; this is not blanket verification of stable Windows or all ARM64 devices.

## Building

Install stable Rust, the MSVC C++ Build Tools, and a Windows SDK. The repository defaults to `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`.

```powershell
cargo build --release
```

To build the 32-bit x86 executable:

```powershell
rustup target add i686-pc-windows-msvc
cargo build --release --target i686-pc-windows-msvc
# Or use: .\scripts\release-clean.ps1 -Target i686-pc-windows-msvc
```

Both pages label the main executable consistently: on ARM64, x86 and x86-64 processes receive
`(x86 emulated)` and `(x86-64 emulated)` suffixes; ARM64EC receives `(ARM64EC)`, and native
ARM64 keeps its name. Ordinary 32-bit compatibility processes retain `(32-bit)`. Failed queries
keep the original name and report a row error. See [architecture detection and validation](docs/process-architecture.md).

For a release build with local paths remapped:

```powershell
.\scripts\release-clean.ps1
```

ARM64 builds also need the Visual Studio C++ ARM64 Build Tools:

```powershell
rustup target add aarch64-pc-windows-msvc
.\scripts\release-clean.ps1 -Target aarch64-pc-windows-msvc
```

The executable is written to `target/<target>/release/taskmgr.exe`.

## Automation

Pull requests and pushes to `main` run formatting, all-target checks, strict Clippy, tests, and an
x86_64 release build on GitHub's Windows Server 2025 / Visual Studio 2026 runner. Separate jobs
compile i686 and ARM64; i686 tests also run under WOW64.

To publish a version, update `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` together and merge the change to `main`.
The Release workflow reads the package version and automatically creates the matching tag (for
example `v0.2.6`) when it does not exist. It then builds all three architectures in parallel,
verifies the PE machine and
Windows version resources, writes `SHA256SUMS.txt`, creates GitHub build-provenance attestations,
and publishes only after the uploaded sizes and digests match. A publishing failure leaves only a
draft; a build failure creates no release, so neither path exposes a partial release.

Workflow dependencies are pinned to immutable commit SHAs. Dependabot checks those pins weekly.

## Diagnostic logs

Redacted basic diagnostics are recorded by default under
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\taskmgr-rs\logs\<session-id>`. Open **Help > Diagnostic Logs...** to inspect the
active session, enable detailed logging for this run, restart while capturing the complete startup
sequence, open the log folder, or save a ZIP diagnostic bundle. Sensitive fields and crash
minidumps are separate, session-only choices and are off by default. A minidump can contain process
memory. Bundles are never uploaded automatically and do not include screenshots, registry options,
or a full process list.

The corresponding command-line switches are:

```text
--diagnostic
--diagnostic=debug
--diagnostic=trace
--diagnostic-sensitive
--diagnostic-minidump
--diagnostic-dir=<absolute-path>
--diagnostic-capabilities=<absolute-path-to-new-json>
```

Logs use versioned JSON Lines records, rotate at 10 MiB per file, and retain at most 10 sessions and
200 MiB. If the normal directory is unavailable, logging falls back to `%TEMP%`; native debugger
output remains available if both locations fail.

The capability command queries processor groups, CPU Sets, DXGI/driver metadata, and the exact GPU
PDH counter paths used by the application, writes an attachable JSON report, and exits without
opening the UI. Unsupported capabilities and native error codes stay explicit. The destination
must be absolute and must not already exist; see the
[matrix and test checklist](docs/compatibility-matrix.md) for usage and privacy details.

To create an optimized GNU build with separate DWARF symbols and a matching executable SHA-256:

```bash
./scripts/build-diagnostics.sh
```

On Windows, `.\scripts\build-diagnostics.ps1` creates an optimized MSVC executable, a separate PDB,
and its SHA-256. Keep `.debug` and PDB files on the developer side; the diagnostic bundle identifies
the executable by hash.

To validate the end-to-end failure chain, developers may set
`TASKMGR_RS_DIAGNOSTIC_INJECT_SAMPLING_ERROR=ntstatus-once` and start with `--diagnostic=trace`.
The first manual **View > Refresh Now** then injects one controlled `STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL`; sampling
recovers automatically afterward. This switch is never persisted and is ignored outside a detailed
startup.

For crash-symbol validation, set `TASKMGR_RS_DIAGNOSTIC_TEST_CRASH=access-violation` and also pass
`--diagnostic=trace --diagnostic-minidump`. This intentionally terminates the process after the
crash recorder is installed, so use it only in an isolated test run. Ordinary, non-detailed, or
non-minidump starts ignore the switch.

## Data sources

CPU topology comes from `GetLogicalProcessorInformationEx`. PDH supplies dynamic frequency and system rates, and WMI supplies firmware data. GPU adapters are enumerated through DXGI; engine and memory counters come from PDH; driver properties come from SetupAPI. Temperature and similar adapter data are read only through supported `D3DKMTQueryAdapterInfo` query types.

The project does not use vendor SDKs, CPU model tables, or `D3DKMTQueryStatistics`. Data sources are committed separately, so one failed query does not clear an otherwise usable page.

## Repository layout

The project remains one Rust crate. Directories follow ownership boundaries rather than putting every type in its own file:

- `src/app` owns the main window, page registry, shared dialog host, and application-wide controllers.
- `src/infrastructure` contains the bounded single-flight worker and small Win32 RAII wrappers shared across features.
- `src/system` contains system sampling, processor topology, and stable process identities.
- `src/pages` owns page state and feature-specific data sources. CPU and GPU have separate native, counter, and metadata modules because those sources have different lifetimes and failure states. Networking and Users stay as single modules while their responsibilities remain compact.
- `src/ui` contains reusable chart, dialog, menu, drawing, resource, and localization code.
- `src/config` owns the versioned registry options format.

Workers publish complete snapshots from one source at a time. The UI rejects stale generations and keeps the last valid snapshot when a refresh fails. Expensive Win32, PDH, DXGI, WMI, WTS, and icon work stays off the UI thread.

## Image resources

The repository stores image sources as PNG or BMP files under `assets`. Windows ICO data is generated in Cargo's `OUT_DIR` during the build and embedded into the EXE by `winresource`; no `.ico` source file is kept or shipped beside the program.

Icon contributions must provide every declared size. The build does not resize images or substitute a nearby file:

- `application-{16,20,24,32,40,48,64,256}.png`
- `default-process-{16,20,24,32,40,48,64}.png`
- `cpu-usage-level-{00..11}-{16,20,24,32}.png`

Each PNG must be square RGBA at the size in its filename. Meter bitmaps live in `assets/bitmaps`, and the application manifest lives at `assets/windows/taskmgr.manifest`. The resource manifest in `build_support/resources.rs` is the source of truth for numeric IDs and expected files.

Run `cargo test --test resource_assets` after changing an image. A release build then checks the same source set before writing the temporary ICO files and compiling the final single-file executable.

## Checks

```powershell
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo check --all-targets
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --all-targets
cargo build --release
git diff --check
```

## Reporting a problem

Open an [Issue](https://github.com/JamesLinYJ/taskmgr-rs/issues) and include the Windows version, CPU and GPU models, the affected page, steps to reproduce, and a screenshot. For compatibility failures, attach a capability JSON; for failures that need precise API or source-line tracing, attach a diagnostic bundle after reviewing its privacy warning. Those details usually make sampling and layout bugs much easier to pin down.
